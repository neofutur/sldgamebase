	description "This modular set of graphene microchannel radiators can be mounted conformally to a ship's hull, improving its ability to radiate away waste heat. The radiative power scales with the temperature of the waste heat being rejected, making Radiative Scales work better for hotter-running ships."
	description "Scales take advantage of special external hardpoints built into most Avgi ships, allowing them to be mounted without taking up any outfit space. However, they also tend to increase the amount of heat absorbed from the local star."

	description "A specialized coating of quantum dot phased array antennas, grown molecule by molecule, forms a conformal film capable of interfering with and jamming any attempts to scan or detect a ship. Working in aggregate, the phased array can be used to jam the sensors of missiles from further away, or even blind them with a low-power beam. However, the density of quantum dots required to produce these effects considerably increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by a ship using Concealment Scales, and such an advanced material does not come cheap."

	description "With massive banks of superconducting magnets, extremely powerful magnetic fields grab ambient hydrogen atoms by their magnetic dipoles, channeling them towards a collection point without needing to first ionize them. This results in a ramscoop that is far more efficient in both fuel collection and energy use than the Electrostatic Ramscoop, but which is utterly massive in size. The magnetic stresses involved are so huge that a dedicated spinal mount is needed to use this ramscoop without tearing the ship apart. Ramscoops like this one were once used in Avgi ram-augmented torchships, allowing them to reach incredible velocities during their sublight interstellar journeys."

As a heatsink, it does not assist with cooling a ship, but allows it to take greater thermal loads while remaining at a safe temperature.`

	description "A scanner with excellent sensitivity by human standards, this array of sensors covers nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from hard x-rays to the softest radio waves. It is able to discern a surprising amount of information about a ship from a significant distance, providing a ship fitted with one with a plethora of targeting data. Additionally, analyzing the albedo of passive objects such as asteroids can reveal the composition of surface deposits at a low accuracy."
	description "To increase the sensitivity of the instrument, certain component sensors require constant cooling to microkelvin scale temperatures. The heat pump system responsible for maintaining this requires a surprising amount of energy, while also producing a small amount of waste heat."

	description "This sensor array features a set of sensitive spectrometers capable of analyzing the spectral signatures of materials in order to determine their composition. A small ultraviolet laser can speed this process up for asteroids by vaporizing a small surface sample, making the spectral lines much more visible, but is sadly useless against shielded ships and their internal systems."
	description "Unfortunately, while Avgi sensors excel in reading basic physical and chemical information, such as the composition of an object, the amount of sensor data required to predict an outfit's functionality means this sensor can be quite slow when scanning a ship's complex systems or cargo."

	description "For its size, you would expect this shield generator to be far more powerful than it actually is. While it is nearly as large as the heaviest human shield generators, it is only about half as strong, while also consuming much more power. Much of this power ends up being shed as waste heat instead of being used to efficiently regenerate a shield."

	description "The largest shield generator manufactured by the Avgi is impressive, if only because of how far the Avgi have pushed their limited theory of shielding principles. While their engineering ingenuity is admirable, there is a limit to how far you can take an incomplete understanding of the base physics behind shielding, and this generator approaches that limit."

Hundreds of kilometers long, the coiled fibers serve as a lasing medium with the power needed to produce an intense beam of light, and can be gain-switched to pulse at a variety of frequencies. The produced laser light, which can be converted to a number of wavelengths, can be easily tapped and routed via optical fibers or mirrors to a number of turrets on a ship, eliminating the need for the heavy lasing generator to be anywhere near the turret itself."
	description "The infrared light produced in the coil can either be passed through a frequency doubling crystal to support up to three Green Optical Lasers, or frequency tripled to support a single Blue Optical Lasers."
