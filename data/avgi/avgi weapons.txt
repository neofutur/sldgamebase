	description "This compact coilgun fires a stream of hypervelocity projectiles, accelerating them on a traveling wave of magnetic energy as capacitors are discharged through a series of coils. Designed primarily for drones and smaller ships, the Speckle is a deadly albeit relatively unsophisticated weapon."
	description "Due to its limited range, the Speckle shines when a ship can sneak close enough to an enemy to bring it to bear, where it can begin tearing through armor and hull. However, its effectiveness is much more limited against shields, which shrug off the its mass driver rounds with relative ease."

	description "Designed for mid-sized ships, this variation on the Speckle Coilgun mounts a pair of coilguns onto a nimble turret. Its compact size allows even smaller ships to fit one, making it a versatile option for mid-ranged combat."
	description "Of course, the inherently limited range and velocity of kinetic weapons makes the Speckle Turret a poor match for some of the longer ranged weapons used by the Avgi, but the sheer firepower it can put out makes it deadly in close range."

	description "This lightweight turret can be fed a beam of light from a lasing generator, which is then combined and focused to produce an intense beam suitable for targeting and destroying missiles. Unlike a typical pulsed-shot human antimissile system, this turret seems designed to hold a beam on target at an extreme distance for a longer period of time using its precise optics, making it better suited for defending and supporting other ships from afar."
	description "The turret itself only contains the optics needed to synthesize, focus, and target the beam, allowing the laser light to be produced elsewhere. Because of this, an Optical Lasing Generator is needed to run this turret, providing enough power to support three Green Lasers."

	description "This lightweight turret can be fed a beam of light from a lasing generator, which is then combined and focused to produce an intense beam ideal for damaging other ships. By pulsing thousands of times each second, the beam can create thermal and mechanical shocks in the target material, enhancing its ability to drill through armor. Unlike the advanced beam weapons used by some other species, this laser is subject to the effects of diffraction, causing its damage to become less intense with distance while also rendering it invisible. However, precise optics allow the beam to be targeted from an exceptional range, despite the tenuous damage at the edge of the laser's reach."
	description "The turret itself only contains the optics needed to synthesize, focus, and target the beam, allowing the laser light to be produced elsewhere. Because of this, an Optical Lasing Generator is needed to run this turret, providing enough power to support a single Blue Laser."

Upon closing in on a target, the missile unwraps into dozens of thin tungsten rods to create a cone shaped area of effect. This makes it difficult to shoot down without very long ranged antimissile systems."
