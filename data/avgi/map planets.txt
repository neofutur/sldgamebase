	description "This was once a particle accelerator several kilometers in diameter. With beamed power provided by the hundreds of solar collection satellites in low orbit around Anax, enough antimatter could be produced each year to supply both Avgi research and industrial efforts."
	description "Combined, the amat farms around Anax produced only a few dozen kilograms of antimatter each year."

planet Omanet
	attributes avgi mining uninhabited
	landscape land/mars0
	description "Omanet is thought to be a chthonian world, a former gas giant whose atmosphere was stripped away until the rocky core was left bare. For whatever reason, Omanet went a step further, and its silicate crust and mantle were also boiled off, leaving behind an extraordinarily dense planet made almost entirely out of metal."
	description "Despite its unfavorable position deep in Anax's gravity well, Omanet was heavily industrialized, with autofabs building enormous discs of nickel-iron anodized with silver. These orbital mirrors are then launched via mass driver, collecting sunlight for uses from industrial asteroid smelting to remote beamed power. Avgi futurists saw this as first steps of a Dyson swarm, but the current rate of mirror assembly will take millennia to exploit a meaningful fraction of Anax's output."

planet Melatos
	attributes avgi uninhabited
	landscape land/snow36
	description "Despite being a large rocky world, Melatos lacks all but the thinnest of atmospheres. Avgi astrogeologists have determined that some cataclysmic event only a few million years ago melted and quickly refroze the outermost layers of its crust. This rapid cooling created a world with a smooth, marble-like texture, almost like ceramic, which is crazed by deep cracks formed as the crust refroze."
	description "The remelting of Melatos' crust also means that heavier elements such as metals mostly sank to the core, and are hard to find without subcrustal mining, an unattractive prospect when combined with the planet's relatively deep gravity well. As such, Melatos remains mostly undeveloped, with the settlements on its surface being almost exclusively scientific in purpose."

	landscape land/mountain39
	description "Aviskir is a world of sweeping mountains and sparkling oceans. It also happens to be the Avgi homeworld, bustling with nine billion members of the species. Civilization has concentrated largely around bountiful mountain valleys and fjords, many warmed by hot springs and geothermal heat. The largest cities are built around the smaller peaks, laced with slender bridges and bright skyscrapers. They stand in contrast to the rural valley settlements below, which are said to offer simpler, more traditional lives."
	description "The Incursion has forced the remaining Avgi on the surface to dedicate a large part of their industry towards building defensive missile systems and banks of lasers, all in the hope of turning away the attack runs the Aberrant sometimes make on the surface."
	spaceport "The largest spaceports once hosted 'beanstalks,' space elevators capable of lifting cargo en masse to geostationary orbit. After the invention of the gravity repulsor, they were largely relegated to historical curiosities, but the Aberrant still severed them during their attack on Aviskir's orbital infrastructure."

	description "A former planetoid captured into Aviskir's orbit only a few hundred million years ago, Sela is unusual for large moons in that it is not tidally locked, instead having a rapid rotational period of only forty-two hours. Almost one third of the moon is covered in a glassy plain of ice, smoothed by seasonal melting and refreezing. This is thought to have been deposited by a cometary impact relatively recently, and has been steadily sublimating away into space ever since."
	description "An Avgi first set foot on another world here, carried by a ship driven by nuclear pulsed propulsion. Driving a ship by detonating small nuclear explosives behind a pusher plate would be seen as insanity by most species, but for the Avgi it was their first stepping stone in the colonization of their home system."

While a few Aberrations sometimes manage to slip past, the gun together with the fleetgroup the platform supports have so far managed to hold the lines."

	description "The Avgi were fortunate to have this nearly habitable planet in their home system. Covered in a thick crust of ice, a deep subsurface ocean lies just below the surface, heated by the radioactive decay of isotopes in its rocky core."
	description "This planet was the first to be settled by the Avgi, who almost immediately began thickening its atmosphere, oxygenating it, and warming the surface with orbital mirrors. Despite beginning this process nearly three centuries ago, it will likely be another century before Thilos becomes warm enough to live on, though its atmosphere is already breathable."
	spaceport "The primary spaceport is located near a region where the icy crust is thin. The landing pads are built from enormous slabs of ice, thick enough to absorb the plume of a fusion torch. During the summer, the plumes of cryovolcanoes often surround the spaceport, tinging the tenuous sky with pale blue streaks."

	description "Because of its shallow gravity well and abundance of volatiles, Entantel is one of the biggest exporters of water ice in the outer Anax system."
	spaceport "The spaceport here launches most upmass via mass driver rather than starship, and despite the abundance of water, and thus deuterium, there is barely enough fuel to fill a few large tankers."

	landscape land/snow25
	description "The first crewed interstellar expedition launched by the Avgi entered orbit first around Iconil, rather than the tantalizingly habitable world of Livoula nearby. This seemingly unorthodox decision was made by the ship's crew because of the dwarf's planet combination of low gravity and clearly visible ice deposits, which offered an easy way to replenish the vessel's propellant. The mission spent several months gathering resources and launching probes before finally crossing the final stretch to settle Livoula, the Avgi's first interstellar colony."

Beyond this, the gravity at this altitude is only slightly stronger than what a typical Avgi is used to, creating a paradoxically habitable area in the skies of a gas planet."
	description "If Saeketer was in the Anax system, it is likely some enterprising group of Avgi in the pre-hyperdrive era would have colonized its skies in aerostat habitats and floating colonies. The newly available real estate in the form of practically pristine terrestrial worlds has unfortunately devalued opportunities such as this, with there being less of a drive to colonize and exploit every body in a given star system."

The Avgi pioneers who volunteered for the mission knew well in advance that the system lacked any garden planets, but were well prepared to spend the rest of their lives in orbital habitats, setting out regardless. Finding a cool, airless moon around a gas giant, the colonists settled down and began constructing habitats and gathering essential resources."
	description "Unfortunately, Span is prone to violent eruptions, and a coronal mass ejection struck after less than a year. Their precision machining equipment was still located on their orbiting starship, and was severely damaged; without that, the colony slowly succumbed to equipment failure until the last living Avgi recorded a farewell poem that remains famous to this day."

These largely come from the planet's rings, which are in the last stages of a decaying orbit that deposits them in broad bands across Uryyhr's surface."

The mountain-born Avgi, however, were rather discomforted by its relatively flat landscape and sluggish winds, and permanent settlement has been sparse."
	description "The oceans are rich in appetizing sea life, and Stilacrest is home to an abundance of independent fishing boats run by those seeking to build a new life away from the homeworld. The lure of the calm waves and mild weather is said to have attracted a meditative, laid back sort of personality."
	spaceport "The largest spaceport is built on the edge of one of the smalller continents, with ample access to the sea. Unlike most Avgi spaceports, the city that grew around it has fairly few skyscrapers or tall buildings, with most structures being short and sprawling."

It was once heavily settled, used as a green space by the miners in the system who grew weary of the confines of their mining vessels."

While unattractive for settlement due to the scarcity of greenery, Amathil is still home to the descendents of those who arrived on the first few sublight starships, back when little was known about the planet besides that it had an oxygenated atmosphere. The unique culture that has since grown here, under a unified planetary government, emphasizes a sense of community and generosity, or at least that is the way the locals are perceived by outsiders."

Continental uplift has made much of this continent characterized by mountainous highland, scattered with numerous springs and lakes. Though the air is thin and the soil is rocky, hardy plants and woody trees cling to life, breaking up the landscape of rocky mountains with colorful meadows and bountiful forests."
	description "Araio garnered a reputation as a frontier world ripe for plucky pioneers, being reminiscent of an often romanticized historical era on Aviskir. While rich in gemstones, natural stones have not been competitive with nanofabbed alternatives since long before the planet was settled, and thus the economy on the surface is almost completely dominated by homesteads and small frontier towns."
	spaceport "Araio's spaceport was small, but well run, capable of efficiently moving small volume goods on and off the world. It was however razed from orbit by the Incursors shortly after the fall of Anax, and the few scouts that are able to sneak through the blockade are forced to use a variety of rocky plateaus instead."
	spaceport "Though imports of advanced technology from other worlds, which the planet lacks the development to manufacture itself, were cut off with the Incursion, the planet is self-sufficient enough to get by for the foreseeable future, even if it means a slight regression in technology."

While temperate near the poles, the equator is inhospitably warm, with constant hurricanes dwarfing anything seen on either Earth or Aviskir raging in the tropics."
	description "	Despite the constant rains and frequent storms, the planet's bountiful oceanic ecosystem is able to sustain a small community of particularly stuborn Avgi, who managed to eke out a life on a rocky island chain. They refused to be evacuated in the wake of the Incursion, and their outpost remains, weathering the wind and sea."

Now, only the metal rich core remains, serving as an alluring target abundant in heavy metals. More recently, Orodens is thought to have supported a hydrological cycle for a brief period, creating rich veins of precipitated minerals. However, the high surface gravity made it costly to transport material to orbit, where it could be shipped to other system. Before the recent invention of the gravity repulsor, rows of mass drivers fired streams of raw material into orbit, where it would be collected by waiting ships."

Many of Katradol's mountains are made mostly of ice, which is strong enough in the extreme cold to stretch upwards for kilometers, even under the high gravity. The roots of these mountains generated some interest in the Avgi scientific community due to the many exotic phases of ice that form under the intense pressures, but Katradol's deep gravity well made ice mining uncompetitive with cometary harvesting in the region.`

Little rain falls outside their drainage basins, but what does fall is bitter and alkaline. The broken remains of what might have once been cities, worn down to little more than circular arrangements of rubble, hints that there is much history here - but no future."

Most are cracked, many others reduced to rubble, and a scant few are intact enough for the deep carvings that cover their surface to be read. These glyphs were seemingly designed to be easily translated, which Avgi researchers quickly did. There was much excitement when it was realized that the monoliths contained instructions and advice on various technologies, but this quickly turned to disappointment when a years-long survey revealed that no monolith had information on anything more advanced than the steam engine."
	description "Whoever left the monoliths here either never documented their more advanced technologies, or someone went to the trouble of destroying the monoliths that contained them."

planet "Peripheria"
	attributes avgi "avgi diaspora" station urban
	landscape land/station54
	description "This enormous, kilometer wide rotating station is the capital of the Avgi civilization in exile. Shaped like a solid disc, it is home to almost a million Avgi, made up of both civilians that were able to flee the core worlds during the invasion and those who already led independent lives in deep space."
	description "The station contains hundreds of levels, with centripetal gravity on the edges being the strongest. The outer rim is perpetually expanded to create more living space, and will likely continue to grow until the structural limits of the station are reached."
	description "The station also hosts the Assembly of Consonant Polities, a league of various nations and communities that now serves as the de-facto species wide government."
	spaceport "An extensive set of docks and shipyards makes up the innermost portion of the station's disc, and you can see dozens of ships in various states of completion."
	spaceport "The usual amenities often located around a spaceport fill a dense ring of shops, restaurants, and other services surrounding the spaceport, but many in the Assembly are considering expanding the spaceport outwards at their expense."

planet "Napigeo Station"
	attributes avgi "avgi diaspora" station military
	landscape land/station50
	description "Napigeo Station is a dedicated shipyard, with dozens of modular drydocks capable of quickly building and repairing ships. Overall, more than two thirds of the large warships in service of the Twilight Guard are built here, though efforts are being made to decentralize warship production for the sake of survivability."
	description "	Due to its importance and nature as a directly government operated shipyard, the station is managed by the Twilight Guard directly. An oversight board appointed by the Assembly maintains a level of civilian governance, but given the composition of the station's population, this is clearly a military installation first and foremost."
	spaceport "The spaceport is closer to being a giant array of drydocks than it is a true port, with the available amenities confined to the bare essentials. You can easily see a dozen warships under construction, with Avgi workers and robotic arms alike working together to churn ships out every day."

planet Weledos
	attributes avgi "avgi diaspora" frontier
	landscape land/water3
	description "Weledos was colonized even before the Avgi evacuated their orbital assets to the Tangled Shroud. A few brave pioneers were willing to settle within the unpredictable systems of the Periphery, largely to escape the planetary governments of core Avgi space. In secret, they surveyed and colonized the planet before most explorers had even reached the Shroud, surprising early scouts with their presence."
	description "	Unfortunately, Weledos and the Ensemble system in general are poor in metals and other natural resources, and civilization here had regressed to almost pre-spaceflight levels by the time the Incursion brought a wave of refugees here. The indefensibility of the system has forced the Avgi diaspora to settle deeper into the Tangled Shroud, despite calls to settle more civilians here."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is large but spartan, equipped as a midway point for convoys and warships transiting between the front lines of the war and the depths of the Tangled Shroud."

planet Aspar
	attributes avgi "avgi diaspora" poisonous uninhabited
	landscape land/forest11
	description "A rarity in the Tangled Shroud, Aspar is a habitable moon with a temperate climate and a thriving ecosystem. Settlement has been light, however, due to the unfortunate fact that life on Aspar uses proteins with the opposite chirality to those used by life on Earth and Aviskir. As a result, the native flora and fauna are mostly inedible, sometimes even being poisonous, and the composition of the soil is such that the plants brought by the Avgi are stunted even if they manage to survive."

planet "Tilo Station"
	attributes avgi "avgi diaspora" dissonance station
	landscape land/space0
	description "Tilo Station was the first major refueling station built in the Tangled Shroud, predating the Incursion, and while it continues to harvest deuterium and helium-3 from the gas giant below, it has largely been supplanted by smaller, less centralized ice-based deuterium refineries. This has led to a degree of neglect by the Assembly, and a posting here is generally regarded as a minor punishment."
	description "	As a result, the station's crew has been thoroughly penetrated by those with sympathies to the Dissonance."

planet "Aktina Cylinder"
	attributes avgi "avgi diaspora" station
	landscape land/station52
	description "Aktina Cylinder is an incomplete space station of an enormous scale. Two dozen kilometers in diameter and three times that in length, when complete it will be able to house tens of millions of Avgi in urban conditions. Thousands of cylinders like these were built over the years in the Avgi core systems, but limited resources have constrained the Avgi in the Tangled Shroud to only building one over the last decade."
	description `	With resources constantly being reallocated towards new warships and mining installations, many wonder if the cylinder will ever be completed, which would provide enough space to allow the millions of Avgi in cryogenic storage to be revived. The main habitat body is still open to space, and the only area sealed against vacuum is a relatively small section tucked under what will be the habitat's "floor."`

	landscape land/station27
	description "Outpost Enka is a huge station built between two large asteroids, which are steadily being mined for the metals and minerals they contain. Most of the habitat is free standing, mounted on the spar that links both asteroids, but one of them also contains significant numbers of pressurized tunnels filled with farms and large green spaces."
	description "Outpost Enka is a major source of nickel-iron ore, which is common in the system despite the overall metal-poor state of the Tangled Shroud. The station is rumored to be a haven for rebels and dissidents even beyond the usual Dissonance supporters."
	spaceport "The station's spaceport is spacious, with room for the many small drones used to harvest other asteroids in the belt. Several berths are also open to larger mining vessels, with a few occupied at the moment."

	landscape land/station25
	description "Outpost Tekis is a station built into a huge asteroid, with tunnels and habitats throughout its entire volume. Its surface is littered with pressurized tubes and habitat domes, many of which grow massive amounts of food in farms and gardens."
	description "Outpost Tekis is a major exporter of titanium and other rare metals, which are otherwise very rare in the metal-poor Tangled Shroud. A local chapter of the Dissonance movement is openly headquartered there, often the public face of negotiations with the Consonance's Assembly."
	spaceport "The spaceport is somewhat cramped, being mostly intended for the intrasystem ships used in asteroid mining. A flexible docking arm allows larger ships to be moored off the asteroid, but you are able to barely squeeze your ship into the main hangar."
