			`	"Why do humans care about art?" The voice now seems far away yet more present than ever. "Because it amazes you, the same way it amazes us to see another kind grow and overcome their burdens. The lives of species are like a painting that never stop being painted, but when they do stop it is a tragic thing to watch. That is why we try to protect these creations of life - so we can see what heights they reach."`
			`	The voice pauses before continuing. "I see that you can not be convinced by me. Even though I could simply wipe you out here and now, I do not favor violence. I will let you pass, but I will be watching you as I am-" you can hear the ultimate resolution in the voice, "-the guardian of this space."`

				`	You manage to dock to the disabled ship quite easily. The lock opens and a hallway opens up before you. It is immediately obvious that this ship was not designed for humans; the walls are strangely curved and the floor has nearly no grip at all. As you carry the necessary repair equipment into the ship, your view is caught by five giant aliens half octopode, half jellyfish in appearance. They pulsate in bright colors similar to the gradients that appeared on your screen earlier. One of them is floating behind a giant mounted gun, and the two barrels are pointed right at you. The gunner flashes in an orange light, and you can feel the tension in the room rising.`

Turning your head you see a gunner flashing in a deep red, before shooting you down and avenging their fallen comrade.`

				`	Feeling that the situation could escalate any moment, you slowly place the crate with the repair equipment on the ground and walk back a few steps. You are careful not to make any hasty movements. Both sides are still for a moment until one of the aliens slowly floats forward. Tones of yellow are now mixing into the creature's orange color, and two of their tentacles wrap around the crate. The other four back off in response. Once the alien manages to open the crate and look inside, its colors shift to a weak green. The rest of the crew also seem to relax as they take on the same color.`
				`	With the repair equipment delivered there is nothing else you can do, given the communication barrier. Just as you leave you can see how the aliens start pulsating in all colors of the spectrum; gradients are moving over their skin so fast that they almost looks white.`

				`	As you fly away you see the engines of the ship slowly booting back up. Apparently they figured out how to use the repair equipment. Instead of leaving the system, however, the ship quietly disappears into the nearest gas giant.`

If you cannot be dissuaded from your course of action, then it is best you are given a means of communication, so that your interactions can at least be on amicable terms. I can provide you with a single one of our translators, which will allow you to contact the species in their home system. Request that they sell you one of their ships, so that you are able to land on their planets."`
			`	It pauses before taking on a more serious tone. "However, you must remember one thing. You are forbidden from granting them any advanced technology of yours. If you agree to that point we shall assist you."`

			`	"Halting the natural increase of a species is unpredictable at the best of times. Your species lacks the wisdom to understand this, as you are young, and have not seen what we have seen." The Quarg pauses for a moment, lost in thought. "The foreseeable risks of even letting you contact them are monumental, and not something you should consider trivial."`
				goto choice

			`	"Happy I am that you agree to that condition. Bear in mind, Captain, that the slightest misstep may have grave consequences." The Quarg stares you down. "We will be watching your actions, to make sure that they are peaceful and without ill or unwise intent. Please for a moment wait here," it says, and walks away.`
			`	The Quarg only takes a moment to come back; it is now carrying a sleek silver box with a display on one side.`
			`	"This is our translator, our link to the Incipias. It is able to translate into your language as well. Be aware of the honor of me handing this you," it says.`
			`	As you stow it away, the Quarg speaks once more. "To satisfactorily utilize this device, you must point it towards the source of the communication, so that it is able to pick up on the emission. Given the complexity of their language, the translator might not be able to adequately translate some parts of their speech. You will understand it when it happens."`
			`	It then looks you directly in the eyes. "Remember what I have told you, human. The stars have no place for those who would act foolishly and thoughtlessly towards their fellow beings." The Quarg then walks away, leaving you alone.`
