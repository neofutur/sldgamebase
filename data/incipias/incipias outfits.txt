	description "The Incipias started to mine asteroids long before they started space travel due to the proximity of their planet's rings. As a result this mining tool seems to be more advanced than their general technology, yet it is still not comparable to the efficiency of human weapons."
	description "The weapon itself shoots bolts of high density plasma that split up into small particles after some time. Because of the plasma infuser the fire rate is exceptional, but the energy usage is severe."

	description "The Stagnation Beam is one of the few technologies of the Incipias that surpasses anything humanity has made thus far - in fact, the first prototypes were built before the Incipias even dreamed of space travel. Giant reactors were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit for easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes."
	description "As the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency, which allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models, much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships."
	description "Officially, these beams are used for mining operations; however, less scrupulous individuals have found they are equally valuable in combat, using the beams to lock down and pull in their opponents."
	description "The secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences."

		"Hicemus Conflict"
	description "The Star Tail Gun needs an extreme amount of energy that the Incipias are not able to create in a short amount of time. To accommodate this, the Star Tail Cell contains an energy-rich substance that releases this energy when fired. One of these cells holds enough energy to fire exactly one shot."

	description "Because Star Tail Cells are highly volatile, they need a robust storage system. This radial design is able to withstand minor explosions by using a variant of a shield that can be deployed temporarily."
	description "One layer of this easily expandable system is already shipped with the gun itself. To increase storage space, more layers are simply stacked on top."

# Shields/Energy:

	"outfit space" -60
	"shield generation" .1
	"energy generation" 4.2
	"heat generation" 5
	description "Shield technology is one of the most recent developments of the Incipias. While this shield appears similar to a human shield device, it works on a completely different basis. In its core hydrogen is burned providing energy for regeneration. This proved so effective that it became the main power source of all of their ships."

outfit "Liquid-Class Shield"
	category "Systems"
	thumbnail "outfit/liquid class shield"
	mass 80
	"outfit space" -90
	"shield generation" .25
	"energy generation" 6.1
	"heat generation" 6
	description "This more advanced shield generator burns a liquid instead of a gas. This raises the efficiency considerably but also requires some extra structures, making this outfit popular only on larger ships."

outfit "Metallic Hydrogen Cell"
	category "Power"
	thumbnail "outfit/metallic hydrogen cell"
	mass 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"energy capacity" 500
	description "Hydrogen energy storage was discovered early by the Incipias because of the great amount of metallic hydrogen on their homeworld. Because Incipias ships usually access their energy at the time it is produced, only a small amount of storage is needed. Most of their ships have only one cell installed as a consequence."

	description "In Incipian culture, blue is the weakest color. An engine labeled with blue does not bode well for the speed of any ship using it."

	description "This steering barely provides the minimum force needed to turn a ship, but it still used often because of how cheap it is."

	description "The Incipias seem to have something against turning their ships. Even though this steering is supposed to be an upgrade from the Blue-Class steering, it is barely an improvement."

	description "The Incipias burn metallic hydrogen to move around in space. As a race that has easy access to metallic hydrogen on their home planet this allows for very efficient engines."

	description "Even the Incipias realize that ships need to turn towards their target to be able to shoot it. This steering is specifically designed for combat but captains with a lot of money find it very useful for mining."
