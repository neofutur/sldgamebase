	description "This beam weapon creates a field inside which otherwise stable atomic nuclei rapidly decay. This effect seems to be inversely proportional to the mass of the nucleus, causing isotopes like deuterium to break down at a higher rate than heavier elements. As the resultant products have a higher energy state than the original nucleus, the beam cools its target, defying conventional thermodynamics."
	description "In practice, this beam can deplete a ship's deuterium fuel while causing the very matter of its hull to decay."

outfit "Telescopic Antimissile"
	category "Turrets"
	cost 6000000

		"velocity" 760
		"lifetime" 1
		"reload" 15
		"firing energy" 90
	description "Oddly enough, this antimissile system resembles an array of scanners and telescopes. Such an assortment of sensing devices was certainly not intended to be used as a weapon, but somehow enough power has been pumped into a scanning beam to make it a potent antimissile defense."
	description "The various lenses and mirrors that make up a large telescope seem to be used to focus the emitted beam, giving this antimissile system a very long range."


# Systems:

outfit "Anomalous Shield Restorer"
	category "Systems"
	cost 22000000
	thumbnail "outfit/anomalous shield restorer"
	"flotsam sprite" "outfit/anomalous shield restorer"
	"mass" 37
	"outfit space" -25
	"shield generation" 3
	"shield energy" 6
	"flotsam chance" 0.1
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "This emitter produces no detectable fields of any kind, but a shield springs into existence whenever something that could damage it comes near enough."


# Power:

outfit "Antimatter Power Cell"
	category "Power"
	cost 11000000
	thumbnail "outfit/antimatter power cell"
	"flotsam sprite" "outfit/antimatter power cell"
	"mass" 34
	"outfit space" -13
	"energy generation" 6.6
	"heat generation" 4.9
	"flotsam chance" 0.1
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "This strange device seems to be partially organic in nature, slowly leaking antiprotons through a constantly-regrowing spongelike structure to release energy. The amount of power produced is inconsistent with the amount of matter and antimatter annihilated, producing more than should be possible."
