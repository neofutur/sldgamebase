	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`Going to the North Pole already makes you feel as if you're on another world. Though you've met some Hai in the past, you've never been among so many of them in one place; the movement of the crowd in this Hai city far outstrips the equatorial human town where you grew up.`
	scene "scene/hai bank"
	`	You head to the bank's lobby, hoping to get enough of a loan to be able to buy one of the pristine ships advertised here.`
	`	To your disappointment, the only ship you can afford is an Aphid. You arrange the contract to loan as much money as you need in order to buy one, in what has to be the first seriously unwise act of your life. However, upon receiving the papers you find out they are in Hai, which you can't make sense of. Probably seeing the confusion on your face, they promptly give you new papers and give you time to read. Only now do you fully realize how risky this is, you might have to cut some costs once you get your hands on the ship.`
	`	Those anxious musings are interrupted when the bank employee finally lays it out to you, with a hesitant smile. "You are accepting a loan in the amount of 1,431,000 credits, due over the course of 2 years, with an interest rate of 0.3% per day. Please sign here."`
	name
	`	You head out of the bank, but see a notice on your way to buy the Aphid at the shipyard. A retiring captain is selling off his fleet at a reduced price, and one of the ships he's offering is a Grasshopper... maybe you could get a deal on it.`
	choice
		`	(Go to the shipyard.)`
			goto shipyard
		`	(Go see what the captain has to offer first.)`
	`	You head to the spaceport and easily find the captain, a Hai, selling one of his Centipedes to another Hai. Thankfully it looks like he has not sold the Grasshopper yet. They happen to be conversing in your language, and you can overhear part of the conversation as the buyer is speaking. "... great that some people still care about helping others make their way to the stars faster, instead of only looking at profit."`
	`	He responds with a smile, "Buying back a ship for a fair price is how I got to the stars myself! It really is a great change of scenery, but I think I got to the point where I want to leave space for others in space, and help others on the ground instead. I am planning on teaching and learning now."`
	`	"What a noble goal indeed," she says, before noticing you, "But it seems you have a new customer here. I will leave you to it." The captain turns to you, "Hello, good fellow! I assume you come for the Grasshopper."`
	choice
		`	"Indeed."`
		`	"How did you know?"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline
	`	"I can see the will to explore in your eyes, and with your age it just seems like the perfect fit. I would be delighted to have you flying the 'Pristine Jewel'!" he says, taking you to the ship. It is clearly not brand new, but is still in a surprisingly good condition.`
	scene "thumbnail/hai grasshopper"
	`	"Because I like you I'll give you a friendly price. What do you say about... a bit over a million credits, for this wonderful ship? That's less than a third the price you would have to pay if you were to buy this model from the shipyard. Except you can't find a model like this in shipyards, trust me!"`
	choice
		`	"Sold!"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested. I'll go to the shipyard instead."`
			goto shipyard
	`	As the two of you settle up the paperwork, the captain takes the time to explain, in great detail, why this ship is so marvelous. In your excitement to buy the ship all you can hear from the Hai captain's speech is the repeated reference to the Grasshopper's 'exceptional' reinforced armor.`

event "not from boston"
	planet "New Boston"
		description `New Boston is a completely unremarkable world. Most of the land here is wet and marshy, and the coastal regions are prone to flooding. The planet's economy is largely agricultural; some of the farms here grow food for export to Earth and elsewhere, but a significant portion of farming land is devoted to growing fiber crops, which is then processed in the textile mills in the spaceport city.`
		spaceport `New Boston's shabby spaceport is as about as basic as a spaceport can be. Many of the concrete landing pads are tilted and uneven, having sunk into the muddy soil since they were poured, and you have to be careful landing on them.`
		spaceport `	The market where ship captains buy and sell cargo is a large tent rather than a permanent building, but it is sturdy enough to keep off the rain. Loads are brought in and out by trucks and the occasional hovercraft. Here some enterprising local mechanics have set up not only a repair shop and outfitter, but also a shipyard with several small, refurbished ships for sale.`

event "grew up on greenwater"
	planet "Greenwater"
		description `Greenwater is unique among Hai worlds, not only in that it is home to a sizable human population, but also because it happens to be the world where you grew up.`
		description `	Most of the humans here live on the islands and archipelagoes across the equator of Greenwater, where the Hai seldom visit on account of their heavy fur coats. From what you hear from humans who have come from beyond the wormhole, the climate here is like a "Paradise Planet," even though it lacks the extensive terraforming common to those worlds.`
		description `	While farming and fishing make up most of the human-centered economy, a few merchants trade with the Hai up in the poles where the spaceport is located.`
